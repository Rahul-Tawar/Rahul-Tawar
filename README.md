## A Little About Me

I’m a computer science student with a passion for generative AI. My current project, **Promptell**, allows users to create and discover AI prompts, combining my interests in technology and creativity.

I have experience with a diverse tech stack, including Go, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, AWS, Django, and the MERN stack, along with a focus on natural language processing (NLP).

I believe in the value of lifelong learning, enjoy reading books, and a part-time lover of physics.
